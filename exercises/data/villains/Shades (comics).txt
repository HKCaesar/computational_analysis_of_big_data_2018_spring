'''Shades''' is the name of a supervillain in [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the father of [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Victor Alvarez]] and is frequently seen with his partner in crime [[Comanche (comics)|Comanche]].

==Publication history==
Shades first appeared in ''[[Luke Cage, Hero for Hire]]'' #1 and was created by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[George Tuska]].

==Fictional character biography==
The unnamed person who grew up to become Shades was raised in [[Harlem]].<ref name="Luke Cage: Hero for Hire #1">''Luke Cage: Hero for Hire'' #1</ref> During his youth, Shades was involved with a woman named Reina Alvarez, with whom he had a son named [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Victor Alvarez]].<ref name="Shadowland: Power Man #1">''Shadowland: Power Man'' #1</ref>

Shades was recruited into a gang called the Rivals which also consisted of [[Luke Cage|Carl Lucas]], [[Diamondback (comics)|Willis Stryker]] and [[Comanche (comics)|Comanche]]. As a member of the Rivals, Shades engaged in a fight with a rival gang called the Diablos and many other gangs while also committing petty crimes and working for crime lord Sonny Caputo. Shades and Comanche were later arrested by the police and sentenced to [[Seagate Prison]] where they were tortured by the ruthless prison guard [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Albert Rackham|Albert "Billy Bob" Rackham]].<ref name="Luke Cage: Hero for Hire #1"/>

After suffering years of torture and abuse from racist prison guard Albert Rackham, Shades and Comanche escaped from Seagate Prison sometime after Albert Rackham was fired. Shades and Comanche decided that it was the opportunity to get revenge on their former tormentor.<ref>''Luke Cage: Hero for Hire'' #14</ref> Shades and Comanche tried to get Luke Cage to help them in their plot only to learn that he has gone straight.<ref>''Luke Cage: Hero for Hire'' #16</ref>

Shades and Comanche returned and became hoodlums-for-hire, often clashing with Luke Cage and his new partner [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].<ref>''Power Man'' #48</ref> Even though they had a past association with Luke Cage, Shades and Comanche indicated that they would kill him if they are ordered to.<ref>''Power Man'' #49</ref>

Sometime later, Shades and Comanche were hired by [[Ward Meachum]] where he gave Shades a visor that shoots energy blasts and gave Comanche some [[Trick arrows|Trick Arrows]]. The two of them knocked out Ward Meachum where they have the bystanders tell Luke Cage that they have a score to settle when Ward Meachum regains consciousness. Luke Cage and Iron Fist tracked Shades and Comanche to the [[George Washington Bridge]] where they learned about their employer. Luke Cage and Iron Fist managed to defeat the two of them as the police arrive. When the police fail to remove Shades' visor, he used one more blast to knock Luke Cage and Iron Fist off the George Washington Bridge.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #98</ref> Shades and Comanche were later sprung from prison.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #99</ref> The two of them tried to hold off Luke Cage when he attacked the Meachum building only to be defeated when Luke Cage knocked a pillar on them.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #100</ref>

Shades was among the several gunmen that were employed by Viktor Smerdilovisc. He and the others came in conflict with the [[Marvel Knights]]. Shades was taken down by [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]].<ref>''Marvel Knights'' #12</ref>

During the 2010 "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]" storyline, Shades appears to have gone straight as he and Comanche have gone their separate ways. When in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], Shades became a [[community organizer]]. He worked with his son Victor where their relationship was strained upon Shades cheating on Reina. Upon Reina moving in with his brother Ignacio with Victor in his company, Shades remained in contact with them the best he could. When [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] had blown up a building during his fight with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] on [[Norman Osborn]]'s orders (as seen during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline), Shades was killed in the explosion while Victor survived upon absorbing the fragments of his father's visor. Upon Victor seeing the chi ghosts of the 107 victims of the explosion, Shades' chi ghost told him to open up and absorb more chi in the area which would give Victor enough power to fight back.<ref name="Shadowland: Power Man #1"/>

* Hernan "Shades" Alvarez appears in ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', portrayed by [[Theo Rossi]].<ref name="deadline">{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/marvel-luke-cage-theo-rossi-cast-shades-rosario-dawson-claire-temple-1201512574/|title=Marvel’s ‘Luke Cage’: Theo Rossi Cast, Rosario Dawson To Reprise &#8216;Daredevil&#8217; Role &#124; Deadline|author=Nellie Andreeva|publisher=deadline.com|accessdate=2016-01-17}}</ref> His nickname comes from his signature pair of [[Ray-Ban]] sunglasses. He was an inmate at Seagate Prison, where he and Comanche were enforcers to corrupt warden Albert Rackham. Shades and Comanche were also responsible for Luke gaining his powers, after they gave him a severe beating for plotting to expose Rackham. After getting out, Shades returned to New York City and became right-hand to Willis Stryker, who later sent him to help out [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Cottonmouth)|Cottonmouth]] and [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]]. After Cottonmouth is killed, Shades works with Mariah to frame Luke for the crime by having worker Candace Miller claim that Luke Cage killed him. As the first season progresses, Shades becomes disillusioned with Diamondback, seeing his methods as detrimental to business, and he and Mariah eventually turn against him even after Shades was nearly killed. After Luke Cage defeats Willis Stryker, Shades doctors evidence to make it look like that Willis Stryker killed Cottonmouth and swiped Misty Knight's cell phone in order to lure Candace Miller out into the open where he would kill Candace Miller rendering her recorded confession of Mariah Dillard and Shades putting her up to the lie annulled. By the end of the first season, Shades helps Mariah Dillard into running the criminal underworld through Harlem's Paradise.

* Shades is referenced in ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' miniseries. In the episode "Mean Right Hook," Turk Barrett mentioned that Mariah Dillard and Shades have "ghosted" when Luke Cage confronts him at the "Trouble in a Pair of Dice" bar to ask him on who has been causing young men in Harlem to commit murders.
