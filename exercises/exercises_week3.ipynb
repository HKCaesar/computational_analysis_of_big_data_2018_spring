    "* *Chapter 5 - Statistics:* In data science we constantly need to summarize data so we can make simple statements that more or less represent whatever complicated thing the underlying data is doing. This chapter introduces some useful tools from statistics that help us do this.\n",
    "* *Chapter 6 - Probability:* Everything is somewhat random, especially data. Probability theory is, therefore—maybe unsurprisingly—the single most important prerequisite to understanding how something like Machine Learning works. This chapter is a bit heavier than the previous two, so we'll take only a few of the most important points with us.\n",

It's a bit too much to also ask you to read this one ahead of class, but we will cover it in the exercises because it relates to today's topic. Worry about this if you get this far today, otherwise just know that concepts like \"p-value\" and \"null-hypothesis\" are super important things that you will bump into sooner or later."
