    "**A word of advice**: Some of you may be new to solving problems using code. At this point you may be wondering what level of detail I expect from your solutions. This is the guideline: Solve the exercises in a manner that allows you to—later in life—use them as examples. This also means that you should add code comments when the code isn't self-explanatory or if you're afraid it won't make sense when you look at it with fresh eyes. You may also want to comment on your output in plain text to capture the conclusions you arrive at throughout your analysis. But express yourself succinctly. When you optimize for your own future comprehension, you also optimize for mine (and your peers')."
